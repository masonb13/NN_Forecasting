Here I will experiment with neural networks, most likely in PyTorch

neural network guessing more than one in the feature at a time is not great
predicting from prediction is even worse

one in the future works pretty nice on average

Paper notes:
choose a constant # epochs, # hidden layers, # prediction values, etc.
Compare the losses and graphs of predictions.

NN->RNN->LSTM->Transformers

try different optimization andd loss functions
